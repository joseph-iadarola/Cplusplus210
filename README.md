# Uploaded project: Bank App (Project 2)
This program created a teaching tool for users to learn about annual interest gains through bank accounts. There is also two simple tables that are created by the program. This project is the one I chose because I used the description of the problem that was given to all the students and created an application that I think followed the instructions very well.
# Future enhancments:
In the future if I was to go back and improve this program I would add graphs to the output and change the entire application into a GUI so that it looks more professional than text printed to the consule screen.
# Challenges
The most challenging part of this code was the user input form. I wanted to have the user input every value at once before continuing, but was not able to and had to do the inputs line by line. For that reason I find the final program a little unprofessional but still functional.
# Skills Learned
The most important thing I learned form this project is the planning and execution differences. When I planned this project with psuedo code, I did not realize I would run into trouble with the user input form. The problem solving that went along with this was very benifitial.
# Maintainable
This program is user friendly because of how simple it is. There is not much going on so it can be changed easily later down the line or is readily functionable now.
